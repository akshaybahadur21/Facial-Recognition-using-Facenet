## Facial Recognition
This code helps in facial recognition using facenets. The concept of facenets was originally presented in a research paper.
The main concepts talked about triplet loss function to compare images of different person.
This concept uses inception network which has been taken from source and fr_utils.py is taken from deeplearning.ai for reference.
I have added several functionalities of my own for providing stability and better detection. 


### Code Requirements
You can install Conda for python which resolves all the dependencies for machine learning.

##### pip install requirements.txt

### Description
A facial recognition system is a technology capable of identifying or verifying a person from a digital image or a video frame from a video source. There are multiples methods in which facial recognition systems work, but in general, they work by comparing selected facial features from given image with faces within a database.

### Functioanlities added
1) Detecting face only when your eyes are opened. (Security measure)
2) Using face align functionality from dlib to predict effectively while live streaming.


### Python  Implementation

1) Network Used- Inception Network
2) Original Paper - Facenet by Google
